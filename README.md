# Bike Blinker
This project is aimed at creating a bicycle turn signal system consisting of two Arduino-compatible boards, communicating via radio. The 'control' board attaches to the bicycle handlebar and is used to set and unset the turn signal, as well as to indicate the active signal. The 'signal' boards connect to the rear of the bicycle, and performs the signaling with an attached LED array. The two modules communicate using a 900mhz radio transciever.
